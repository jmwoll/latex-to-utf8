A latex-to-utf8 autohotkey script.
The default trigger is the (in any case useless) capslock key.
For example, pressing (meant like this: first press capslock then type out "\\-l-a-m-b-d-a")
```
<capslock>+\lambda
```
which will result in the utf-8 character "λ" being printed out. Many common
math symbols are already added, and new ones are quickly added, too.
Very handy if you want latex-style shortcuts in other applications.

Currently supported symbols:


| Symbol        | Command       | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| **greek**     | right-aligned | 
| \\alpha       |       α      |  
| \\beta        |       β      |  
| \\gamma       |       γ      |  
| \\delta       |       δ      |  
| \\epsilon     |       ε      |  
| \\stigma      |       ϛ      |
